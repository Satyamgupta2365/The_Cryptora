# Placeholder for existing endpoints (move from main.py if needed)
# For example, you might move wallet, hedera, and llm endpoints here
# For simplicity, assuming main.py keeps those endpoints
# Add any specific routes if needed

# Note: If you want to move endpoints from main.py to here, let me know!
